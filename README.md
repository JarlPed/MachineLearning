# MachineLearning
Machine learning examples, using python.

The motivation for this repository is to provide machine learning examples and compare its performance.

Examples
1: A simple PID minimization of the OpenAI PoleCart i.e. inverted pendulum is solved with a simple Newton-Raphson maximizer using central gradients. No Neural networks is used, but is useful to compare other AI structures.
